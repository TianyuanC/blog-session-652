### TL;DW (watch)

-   Postman is an awesome tool to explore various endpoints of your backend API, it supports `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` verbs as well as payload and headers. You can even write automation scripts to execute smoke, load and regression tests on your backend API.
-   You can download Postman <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/" target="_blank">here</a>
-   You can import the Books API collections <a href="/media/books.postman_collection.json" target="_blank">here</a>
