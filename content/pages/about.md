Welcome to Udacity's React Nanodegree, I'm your mentor Ryan. You are here because we all belong to this small study group (around 11 people), called **SESSION 652** üòÇ.

### TL;DR

-   Slack will be our main communication channel, and we will have our weekly 1:1 chat, ama (ask-me-anything) session, reminders and updates over there.
-   We also have weekly knowledge webinar hosted by myself.  
    (So every Saturday, I will be presenting topics that are frequently asked in this group as well the ones I found interesting. Yes, like a YouTuber. So feel free to interact with me during the live broadcasting! Also, don't worry if you miss the live show, cuz there will always be recordings available shortly after.)
-   DM (direct message) me, I won't bite ü¶Å

### Show Me What You Got

![potato_head_show_me_what_u_got](/media/potato_head.jpg)
In this nanodegree, firstly, we will be learning the basics of React

-   its `<JSX />` syntax
-   states/props
-   the uni-directional update flow
-   the lifecycle methods and so on...

Don't step away yet, that's only the beginning. You will soon notice that it's the whole ecosystem that is making React so amazing

-   you can use `react-router` to split routes for your SPA (single page application)
-   `redux` and `react-redux` can be used to manage complicated states inside your application
-   you can also write your own react components and share with others by publishing to npm.

Web, boring, what about mobile apps?

Have you ever built a mobile app which renders everything inside a `WebView`? Do you like it?

Of course not, you are basically turning your app into a web browser! Only native controls can give the best user experience as well as the performance.

In the last section, we will learn React Native, where you can use the React you already know and love to build native iOS and android applications.
